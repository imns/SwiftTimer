# SwiftTimer


**This is very much a work in progress**


```swift
import SwiftTimer

let timerSequence = TimerSequence()
timerSeq.addTimer(duration: 30, category: "category-1", title: "Timer 1")
timerSeq.addTimer(duration: 60, category: "category-1", title: "Timer 2")
timerSeq.addTimer(duration: 60, category: "category-2", title: "Timer 3")
timerSeq.startTimer()
```
